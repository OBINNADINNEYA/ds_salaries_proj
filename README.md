# Data Science Job Salaries in Toronto, CA

## Overview
In this project, we delve deep into the salaries associated with data science jobs in Toronto. Leveraging web scraping, NLP, and machine learning techniques, we extract, process, analyze, and visualize data from real-time job postings. Our goal is to provide comprehensive insights into the Toronto data science job market and offer a tool to predict job salaries based on the provided job description.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping**: Developed a custom web scraper to fetch 750 real-time data science job listings from Glassdoor.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzed job descriptions using NLP techniques to generate an informative word cloud, highlighting the key skills and requirements.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Aggregated and visualized the job data using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to craft a detailed EDA report.
4. **Data Cleaning & Analysis**: Used Python to meticulously clean and analyze the job listings, extracting valuable insights into the ideal job characteristics and requirements.
5. **Machine Learning**: Implemented advanced machine learning techniques to predict job salaries in the data science domain, emphasizing feature engineering and model selection.
6. **API Deployment**: Productionized the Random Forest model by building a Flask endpoint API, enabling users to easily predict salaries based on job descriptions.
